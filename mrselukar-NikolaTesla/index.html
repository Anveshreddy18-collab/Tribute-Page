        <h4 class="heading-priary">Synopsys</h4>
        <p>Born on July 1856, in what is now Croatia Nikola Tesla came to USA in 1884.
          He worked with Thomas Edison for a shortwhile before parting ways. He sold several patent rights,
          including those to the alternating current macheinery, to George Westinghouse. His 1891 invention, the "Tesla coil",
          is still used in radio technology today. Tesla died in New York on January 7 1943,</p>
        <h4 class="heading-primary">Early Life</h4>
        <p>Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
          His father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox church and his mother managed the family’s farm.
           In 1863 Tesla’s brother Daniel was killed in a riding accident.
           The shock of the loss unsettled the 7-year-old Tesla,
           who reported seeing visions—the first signs of his lifelong mental illnesses.
           Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the University of Prague.
            In 1882, while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor,
            making the first sketches of its rotating electromagnets in the sand of the path.
            Later that year he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct current
            (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Company.
            Two years later he immigrated to the United States.
            <h4>The Rise</h4>
            <p>
            	He arrived is USA in 1884 with just 4 cents in his pocket and after a fwe jobs started working for Thomas Edison. In 1885 he accepted an offer to redesign Edisons DC powered machines for One Million US dollars in todays currency, after completing the job when Tesla asked for money Edison replied "Mr Tesla you do not understand our American humor"and offered him a $10/HR raise, and thus they parted ways.
            	He took up a digging ditches job to make ends meet and after some time finally struck a deal with George Westinghouse, which put him in direct competition to Edison and his DC system. The Edisons DC system was inefficient, couldn't transfer very far and required wires as thick as a human arm where as Teslas AC system was efficient required thin cables and had higher voltages and could transmit over long distances. This period was known as the 'War of The Currents' Tesla won and gained the title of 'The Man who lit the entire World' Edison tried to stop Teslas AC by Co-developing the Electric Chair, making sure it ran on AC and electrocuted animals in public. Tesla responded by performing the famous Tesla coil experiments i.e shooting electric current through his own body to produce light is the 1893 World Fare. As a result of his inventions Tesla was shot into fame rubbing shoulders with the most important people of the day and was universally loved by the people as his mad there life easy. But Tesla was just getting started.

            <h4>The Fall</h4>
            <p>Having become obsessed with the wireless transmission of energy, around 1900 Nikola set to work on his boldest project yet: to build a global, wireless communication system—to be transmitted through a large electrical tower—for sharing information and providing free electricity throughout the world. With funding from a group of investors that included financial giant J. P. Morgan, in 1901 Tesla began work on the project in earnest, designing and building a lab with a power plant and a massive transmission tower on a site on Long Island, New York, that became known as Wardenclyffe. However, when doubts arose among his investors about the plausibility of Tesla's system and his rival, Guglielmo Marconi—with the financial support of Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Edison—continued to make great advances with his own radio technologies, Tesla had no choice but to abandon the project. The Wardenclyffe staff was laid off in 1906 and by 1915 the site had fallen into foreclosure. Two years later Tesla declared bankruptcy and the tower was dismantled and sold for scrap to help pay the debts he had accrued.
